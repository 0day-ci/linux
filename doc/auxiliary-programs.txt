			AUXILIARY PROGRAMS FOR TESTING
			==============================

Not everything a test script can do is easily done within a test script;
sometimes it makes a lot more sense to write auxiliary program in C and have
the test script call them.  Auxiliary commands can be found in the src/
directory and in other packages.

Tests wanting to use an auxiliary program found in the src/ directory should
note the dependency with:

	_require_test_program "<program-name>"


Contents:

 - af_unix	-- Create an AF_UNIX socket
 - stat_test	-- statx syscall exercise
 - xfs_io	-- General I/O operation exercise


==================
QUICK DESCRIPTIONS
==================

af_unix

	The af_unix program creates an AF_UNIX socket at the given location.

stat_test

	The stat_test program is primarily designed to exercise the statx()
	system call.  It can check statx() against fstatat() and it can
	compare and check various file attributes.

	See also:
		_require_statx


xfs_io

	The xfs_io program can be found in the xfsprogs package and can be used
	to perform sequences of I/O commands, though it is limited to what it
	can do on open files.

	xfs_io is a debugging tool that is aimed at examining regular file I/O
	paths rather than a raw XFS volume itself.  These code paths include
	not only the obvious read/write/mmap interfaces for manipulating files,
	but also cover all of the XFS extensions (such as space preallocation,
	additional inode flags, etc).

	Most of its commands can also be used with other filesystems.

	See also:
		_require_xfs_io_command
