	  Enable encryption of files and directories.  This
	  feature is similar to ecryptfs, but it is more memory
	  efficient since it avoids caching the encrypted and
	  decrypted pages in the page cache.  Currently Ext4,
	  F2FS and UBIFS make use of this feature.

# Filesystems supporting encryption must select this if FS_ENCRYPTION.  This

	  This pulls in the generic implementations of the various
	  cryptographic algorithms and chaining modes that filesystem
	  encryption relies on. These are 'soft' dependencies only, as
	  architectures may supersede these generic implementations with
	  special, optimized ones.

	  If unsure, keep the generic algorithms enabled, as they can
	  happily co-exist with per-architecture implementations.
