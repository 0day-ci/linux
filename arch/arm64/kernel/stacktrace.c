/*
 * Special functions where the stack trace is unreliable.
 *
 * EL1 exceptions
 * ==============
 *
 * EL1 exceptions can happen on any instruction including instructions in
 * the frame pointer prolog or epilog. Depending on where exactly they happen,
 * they could render the stack trace unreliable.
 *
 * If an EL1 exception frame is found on the stack, mark the stack trace as
 * unreliable. Now, the EL1 exception frame is not at any well-known offset
 * on the stack. It can be anywhere on the stack. In order to properly detect
 * an EL1 exception frame, the return address must be checked against all of
 * the possible EL1 exception handlers.
 *
 * Interrupts encountered in kernel code are also EL1 exceptions. At the end
 * of an interrupt, the current task can get preempted. A stack trace taken
 * on the task after the preemption will show the EL1 frame and will be
 * considered unreliable. This is correct behavior as preemption can happen
 * practically at any point in code.
 *
 * Breakpoints encountered in kernel code are also EL1 exceptions. Breakpoints
 * can happen practically on any instruction. Mark the stack trace as
 * unreliable. Breakpoints are used for executing probe code. Stack traces
 * taken while in the probe code will show an EL1 frame and will be considered
 * unreliable. This is correct behavior.
 *
 * FTRACE
 * ======
 *
 * When CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS is enabled, the FTRACE trampoline code
 * is called from a traced function even before the frame pointer prolog.
 * FTRACE sets up two stack frames (one for the traced function and one for
 * its caller) so that the unwinder can provide a sensible stack trace for
 * any tracer function called from the FTRACE trampoline code.
 *
 * There are two cases where the stack trace is not reliable.
 *
 * (1) The task gets preempted before the two frames are set up. Preemption
 *     involves an interrupt which is an EL1 exception. The unwinder already
 *     handles EL1 exceptions.
 *
 * (2) The tracer function that gets called by the FTRACE trampoline code
 *     changes the return PC (e.g., livepatch).
 *
 *     Not all tracer functions do that. But to err on the side of safety,
 *     consider the stack trace as unreliable in all cases.
 *
 * When Function Graph Tracer is used, FTRACE modifies the return address of
 * the traced function in its stack frame to an FTRACE return trampoline
 * (return_to_handler). When the traced function returns, control goes to
 * return_to_handler. return_to_handler calls FTRACE to gather tracing data
 * and to obtain the original return address. Then, return_to_handler returns
 * to the original return address.
 *
 * There are two cases to consider from a stack trace reliability point of
 * view:
 *
 * (1) Stack traces taken within the traced function (and functions that get
 *     called from there) will show return_to_handler instead of the original
 *     return address. The original return address can be obtained from FTRACE.
 *     The unwinder already obtains it and modifies the return PC in its copy
 *     of the stack frame to the original return address. So, this is handled.
 *
 * (2) return_to_handler calls FTRACE as mentioned before. FTRACE discards
 *     the record of the original return address along the way as it does not
 *     need to maintain it anymore. This means that the unwinder cannot get
 *     the original return address beyond that point while the task is still
 *     executing in return_to_handler. So, consider the stack trace unreliable
 *     if return_to_handler is detected on the stack.
 *
 * NOTE: The unwinder must do (1) before (2).
 *
 * KPROBES
 * =======
 *
 *	There are two types of kprobes:
 *
 *	(1) Regular kprobes that are placed anywhere in a probed function.
 *	    This is implemented by replacing the probed instruction with a
 *	    breakpoint. When the breakpoint is hit, the kprobe code emulates
 *	    the original instruction in-situ and returns to the next
 *	    instruction.
 *
 *	    Breakpoints are EL1 exceptions. When the unwinder detects them,
 *	    the stack trace is marked as unreliable as it does not know where
 *	    exactly the exception happened. Detection of EL1 exceptions in
 *	    a stack trace will be done separately.
 *
 *	(2) Return kprobes that are placed on the return of a probed function.
 *	    In this case, Kprobes sets up an initial breakpoint at the
 *	    beginning of the probed function. When the breakpoint is hit,
 *	    Kprobes replaces the return address in the stack frame with the
 *	    kretprobe_trampoline and records the original return address.
 *	    When the probed function returns, control goes to the trampoline
 *	    which eventually returns to the original return address.
 *
 *	    Stack traces taken while in the probed function or while in the
 *	    trampoline will show kretprobe_trampoline instead of the original
 *	    return address. Detect this and mark the stack trace unreliable.
 *	    The detection is done by checking if the return PC falls anywhere
 *	    in kretprobe_trampoline.
