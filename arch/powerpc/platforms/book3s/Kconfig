	  This enables support for IBM Virtual Accelerator Switchboard (VAS).

	  VAS allows accelerators in co-processors like NX-GZIP and NX-842
	  to be accessible to kernel subsystems and user processes.
	  VAS adapters are found in POWER9 and later based systems.
	  The user mode NX-GZIP support is added on P9 for powerNV and on
	  P10 for powerVM.

	  If unsure, say "N".
