	help
	  Select if you want SYSFS support for the MIO and reset functionality
	  available in SLCR. This driver doesn't provide an interface for
	  accessing all the other registers in SLCR.

	bool "Run the Kernel For AMP on CPU0"
	help
	  Select if you want to run the kernel on CPU0 while also running 
	  another kernel on CPU1 as a slave with respect to interrupt management.
	  This causes the kernel to push the 2nd set of device interrupts
	  to CPU1 so that it has it's own system.

config XILINX_AMP_CPU1_SLAVE
	bool "Run the Kernel For AMP on CPU1" 
	help
	  Select if you want to run the kernel on CPU1 while also running
	  another kernel on CPU0 as a master with respect to interrupt management.
	  This causes the kernel to not touch the GIC distributor when it initializes
	  as CPU0 takes care of it.

config XILINX_CPU1_TEST
	bool "Run the Kernel On CPU1 For Testing"
	help
	  Select if you want to run the kernel on CPU1 without running a kernel on
	  CPU0 which is really only useful for testing purposes.  The really only
	  causes interrupts in the GIC to be on CPU1 rather than CPU0.
