Kernel driver ina238
====================

Supported chips:

  * Texas Instruments INA238

    Prefix: 'ina238'

    Addresses: I2C 0x40 - 0x4f

    Datasheet:

Description
-----------

The INA238 is a current shunt, power and temperature monitor with an I2C
interface. It includes a number of programmable functions including alerts,
conversion rate, sample averaging and selectable shunt voltage accuracy.

The shunt value in micro-ohms can be set via platform data or device tree at
compile-time or via the shunt_resistor attribute in sysfs at run-time. Please
refer to the Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwmon/ti,ina2xx.yaml for bindings
if the device tree is used.

Sysfs entries
-------------

======================= =======================================================
in0_input		Shunt voltage (mV)
in0_lcrit		Critical low shunt voltage
in0_crit		Critical high shunt voltage

in1_input		Bus voltage (mV)
in1_lcrit		Critical low bus voltage (mV)
in1_crit		Critical high bus voltage (mV)

power1_input		Power measurement (uW)
power1_crit		Critical power limit (uW)

curr1_input		Current measurement (mA)

temp1_input		Die temperature measurement (mC)
temp1_crit		Critical die temperature limit (mC)

shunt_resistor		Shunt resistance (uOhm)
======================= =======================================================

.. note::

   - Configure `shunt_resistor` before configure `power1_crit`, because power
     value is calculated based on `shunt_resistor` set.
