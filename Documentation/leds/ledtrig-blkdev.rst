Block Device (blkdev) LED Trigger
=================================

Available when ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV=y`` or
``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV=m``.

See also:

* ``Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-blkdev``
* ``Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-block`` (``/sys/block/<disk>/linked_leds``)

Overview
========

.. note::
	The examples below use ``<LED>`` to refer to the name of a
	system-specific LED.  If no suitable LED is available on a test
	system (in a virtual machine, for example), it is possible to
	use a userspace LED.  (See ``Documentation/leds/uleds.rst``.)

Verify that the ``blkdev`` LED trigger is available::

	# grep blkdev /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
	... rfkill-none blkdev

(If the previous command produces no output, you may need to load the trigger
module - ``modprobe ledtrig_blkdev``.  If the module is not available, check
the value of ``CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_BLKDEV`` in your kernel configuration.)

Associate the LED with the ``blkdev`` LED trigger::

	# echo blkdev > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger

	# cat /sys/class/leds/<LED>/trigger
	... rfkill-none [blkdev]

Note that several new device attributes are available in the
``/sys/class/leds/<LED>`` directory.

* ``link_device`` and ``unlink_device`` are used to manage the set of block
  devices associated with this LED.  The LED will blink in response to read or
  write activity on its linked devices.

* ``mode`` is used to control the type of device activity that will cause this
  LED to blink - read activity, write activity, or both.  (Note that any
  activity that changes the state of a device's non-volatile storage is
  considered to be a write.  This includes discard and cache flush requests.)

* ``blink_time`` is the duration (in milliseconds) of each blink of this LED.
  (The minimum value is 10 milliseconds.)

* The ``linked_devices`` directory will contain a symbolic link to every device
  that is associated with this LED.

Link a block device to the LED::

	# echo sda > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_device

	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
	sda

Read and write activity on the device should cause the LED to blink.  The
duration of each blink (in milliseconds) can be adjusted by setting
``/sys/class/leds/<LED>/blink_time``.  (But see **interval and blink_time**
below.)

Associate a second device with the LED::

	# echo sdb > /sys/class/leds/<LED>/link_device

	# ls /sys/class/leds/<LED>/linked_devices
	sda  sdb

When a block device is linked to one or more LEDs, the LEDs are linked from
the device's ``linked_leds`` directory::

	# ls /sys/block/sd{a,b}/linked_leds
	/sys/block/sda/linked_leds:
	<LED>

	/sys/block/sdb/linked_leds:
	<LED>

(The ``linked_leds`` directory only exists when the block device is linked to
at least one LED.)

``interval`` and ``blink_time``
===============================

* By default, linked block devices are checked for activity every 100
  milliseconds.  This frequency can be changed via the
  ``/sys/class/ledtrig_blkdev/interval`` attribute.  (The minimum value is 25
  milliseconds.)

* All associated devices are checked for activity every ``interval``
  milliseconds, and a blink is triggered on appropriate LEDs.  The duration
  of an LED's blink is determined by its ``blink_time`` attribute.  Thus
  (assuming that activity of the relevant type has occurred on one of an LED's
  linked devices), the LED will be on for ``blink_time`` milliseconds and off
  for ``interval - blink_time`` milliseconds.

* The LED subsystem ignores new blink requests for an LED that is already in
  in the process of blinking, so setting a ``blink_time`` greater than or equal
  to ``interval`` will cause some blinks to be missed.

* Because of processing times, scheduling latencies, etc., avoiding missed
  blinks actually requires a difference of at least a few milliseconds between
  the ``blink_time`` and ``interval``.  The required difference is likely to
  vary from system to system.  As a  reference, a Thecus N5550 NAS requires a
  difference of 7 milliseconds (``interval == 100``, ``blink_time == 93``).

* The default values (``interval == 100``, ``blink_time == 75``) cause the LED
  associated with a continuously active device to blink rapidly.  For a more
  "always on" effect, increase the ``blink_time`` (but not too much; see the
  previous bullet).

Other Notes
===========

* Many (possibly all) types of block devices work with this trigger, including:

  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) hard disk drives and SSDs
  * SCSI (including SATA and USB) optical drives
  * NVMe SSDs
  * SD cards
  * loopback block devices (``/dev/loop*``)
  * device mapper devices, such as LVM logical volumes
  * MD RAID devices
  * zRAM compressed RAM-disks
  * partitions on block devics that support them

* The device names written to the ``link_device`` and ``unlink_device``
  attributes must be kernel names (the names shown in
  ``/sys/class/block``).  Symbolic link names, such as the names commonly
  used to access logical volumes will not work.  (Kernel names of logical
  volumes and other device mapper devices can be seen as link targets in the
  ``/dev/mapper`` directory.)

* The ``blkdev`` LED trigger supports many-to-many device/LED associations.
  A device can be associated with multiple LEDs, and an LED can be associated
  with multiple devices.
