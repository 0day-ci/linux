Watchdog monitor
----------------

The watchdog is an essential building block for the usage of Linux in
safety-critical systems because it allows the system to be monitored from
an external element - the watchdog hardware, acting as a safety-monitor.

A user-space application controls the watchdog device via the watchdog
interface. This application, hereafter safety_app, enables the watchdog
and periodically pets the watchdog upon correct completion of the safety
related processing.

If the safety_app, for any reason, stops pinging the watchdog,
the watchdog hardware can set the system in a fail-safe state. For
example, shutting the system down.

Given the importance of the safety_app / watchdog hardware couple,
the interaction between these software pieces also needs some
sort of monitoring. In other words, "who monitors the monitor?"

The safe watchdog (safe_wtd) RV monitor monitors the interaction between
the safety_app and the watchdog device, enforcing the correct sequence of
events that leads the system to a safe state.

Furthermore, the safety_app can monitor the RV monitor by collecting the
events generated by the RV monitor itself via tracing interface. In this way,
closing the monitoring loop with the safety_app.

A diagram of the components and their interactions is::

Sample safety_app
-----------------

The user-space safety_app sample code in ``tools/tracing/rv/safety_app/``
serves to illustrate the usage of the RV monitors for this use-case, as
well as the starting point to the development of a user-specific safety_app.

Watchdog events
---------------

The RV monitor observes the watchdog by using instrumentation to
process the events generated by the interaction between the
safety_app and the watchdog device layer in kernel.

The monitored events are:

  - watchdog:watchdog_open: open the watchdog device;
  - watchdog:watchdog_close: close the watchdog device;
  - watchdog:watchdog_start: start the watchdog;
  - watchdog:watchdog_stop: stop the watchdog;
  - watchdog:watchdog_set_timeout: set the watchdog timeout;
  - watchdog:watchdog_ping: reprogram the watchdog with the previously set
    timeout;
  - watchdog:watchdog_nowayout: prevents the watchdog from stopping;
  - watchdog:watchdog_set_keep_alive: set an intermediary ping to overcome
    the limitation of a hardware watchdog maximum timeout being shorter than
    the timeout set by the user-space tool;
  - watchdog:watchdog_keep_alive: the execution of the function that runs the
    intermediary keep alive ping;

RV monitor events
-----------------

The RV monitor monitors the relevant events as an outside observer,
interpreting all the components (the hardware; the watchdog device
interface; and the safety monitor) as an integrated component.

The events selected for the monitor are:

  - other_threads: an event generated by any thread other than the
    one that set nowayout or open the watchdog the last time.
  - open: a thread opens the watchdog to manipulate it;
  - close: a thread closes the watchdog;
  - start: starts the watchdog countdown;
  - stop: stops the watchdog;
  - set_safe_timeout: configures the watchdog with a given timeout;
  - ping: resets the watchdog countdown with the previously configured timeout;
  - nowayout: prevents the watchdog to be stopped until the system's shutdown;
  - sched_keep_alive: schedules a kernel worker to ping the watchdog if the
    timeout is longer than the watchdog hardware can handle.
  - keep_alive: executes the previously scheduled watchdog ping;

Noting that the events that does not appear in the automata models are
considered blocked events, and their execution will always cause the
RV monitor to react to an unexpected event.

RV monitor specification
------------------------

The monitor's goal is to assess a set of specifications that conducts the
system to a safe state.

These specifications are:

  - 1: Once open, only one process manipulates the watchdog;
  - 2: Following 1, the keep-alive mechanisms will not be used;
  - 3: If required, nowayout will be set before opening the watchdog;
  - 4: A safe timeout must be set;
  - 5: At least one ping must be made before entering the safe/safe_nwo states
  - 6: The The RV monitor does not react if the watchdog is closed without stopping.
       But the hardware watchdog is expected to react.

Deterministic automata monitors
-------------------------------

Following the specifications, two deterministic automata monitors
were developed. The are the safe_wtd and the safe_wtd_nwo monitors.
The monitors are modeled as Deterministic Automata models.

The difference between the safe_wtd and the safe_wtd_nwo is that
the latter enforces the usage of the watchdog's nowayout option
to reach the safe state.

The deterministic automata model for safe_wtd is::

It is important to note that the events sched_keep_alive and keep_alive
are not allowed on any of the present monitors (they are said to be blocked
events). The execution of any blocked events leads the RV monitor to react.

Additional options
------------------

The RV monitor also has a set of options enabled via kernel command
line/module options. They are:

 - watchdog_id: the device id to monitor (default 0);
 - dont_stop: once enabled, do not allow the RV monitor to be stopped (default off);
 - safe_timeout: define a maximum safe value that a user-space application can
   set as the watchdog timeout (default unlimited);
 - check_timeout: After every ping, check if the time left in the watchdog is less
   than or equal to the last timeout set for the watchdog. It only works for watchdog
   devices that provide the get_timeleft() function (default off);
