Synchronous Ethernet
====================

Synchronous Ethernet networks use a physical layer clock to syntonize
the frequency across different network elements.

Basic SyncE node defined in the ITU-T G.8264 consist of an Ethernet
Equipment Clock (EEC) and a PHY that has dedicated outputs of recovered clocks
and a dedicated TX clock input that is used as to transmit data to other nodes.

The SyncE capable PHY is able to recover the incomning frequency of the data
stream on RX lanes and redirect it (sometimes dividing it) to recovered
clock outputs. In SyncE PHY the TX frequency is directly dependent on the
input frequency - either on the PHY CLK input, or on a dedicated
TX clock input.

The EEC can synchronize its frequency to one of the synchronization inputs
either clocks recovered on traffic interfaces or (in advanced deployments)
external frequency sources.

Some EEC implementations can select synchronization source through
priority tables and synchronization status messaging and provide necessary
filtering and holdover capabilities.

The following interface can be applicable to diffferent packet network types
following ITU-T G.8261/G.8262 recommendations.

Interface
=========

The following RTNL messages are used to read/configure SyncE recovered
clocks.

RTM_GETRCLKRANGE
-----------------
Reads the allowed pin index range for the recovered clock outputs.
This can be aligned to PHY outputs or to EEC inputs, whichever is
better for a given application.
Will call the ndo_get_rclk_range function to read the allowed range
of output pin indexes.
Will call ndo_get_rclk_range to determine the allowed recovered clock
range and return them in the IFLA_RCLK_RANGE_MIN_PIN and the
IFLA_RCLK_RANGE_MAX_PIN attributes

RTM_GETRCLKSTATE
-----------------
Read the state of recovered pins that output recovered clock from
a given port. The message will contain the number of assigned clocks
(IFLA_RCLK_STATE_COUNT) and an N pin indexes in IFLA_RCLK_STATE_OUT_IDX
To support multiple recovered clock outputs from the same port, this message
will return the IFLA_RCLK_STATE_COUNT attribute containing the number of
active recovered clock outputs (N) and N IFLA_RCLK_STATE_OUT_IDX attributes
listing the active output indexes.
This message will call the ndo_get_rclk_range to determine the allowed
recovered clock indexes and then will loop through them, calling
the ndo_get_rclk_state for each of them.

RTM_SETRCLKSTATE
-----------------
Sets the redirection of the recovered clock for a given pin. This message
expects one attribute:
struct if_set_rclk_msg {
	__u32 ifindex; /* interface index */
	__u32 out_idx; /* output index (from a valid range)
	__u32 flags; /* configuration flags */
};

Supported flags are:
SET_RCLK_FLAGS_ENA - if set in flags - the given output will be enabled,
		     if clear - the output will be disabled.

RTM_GETEECSTATE
----------------
Reads the state of the EEC or equivalent physical clock synchronizer.
This message returns the following attributes:
IFLA_EEC_STATE - current state of the EEC or equivalent clock generator.
		 The states returned in this attribute are aligned to the
		 ITU-T G.781 and are:
		  IF_EEC_STATE_INVALID - state is not valid
		  IF_EEC_STATE_FREERUN - clock is free-running
		  IF_EEC_STATE_LOCKED - clock is locked to the reference,
		                        but the holdover memory is not valid
		  IF_EEC_STATE_LOCKED_HO_ACQ - clock is locked to the reference
		                               and holdover memory is valid
		  IF_EEC_STATE_HOLDOVER - clock is in holdover mode
State is read from the netdev calling the:
int (*ndo_get_eec_state)(struct net_device *dev, enum if_eec_state *state,
			 u32 *src_idx, struct netlink_ext_ack *extack);

IFLA_EEC_SRC_IDX - optional attribute returning the index of the reference that
		   is used for the current IFLA_EEC_STATE, i.e., the index of
		   the pin that the EEC is locked to.

Will be returned only if the ndo_get_eec_src is implemented.
