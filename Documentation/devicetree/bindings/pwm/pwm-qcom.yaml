description:
  PWM modules inside Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMICs can be accessed through
  SPMI bus and normally one PMIC would have multiple PWM modules with adjacent
  SPMI address space.

Properties:
  compatible:
    const: qcom,pwm

  reg:
    description:
      The SPMI address base of the PWM module, if there are multiple PWM
      modules present with adjacent SPMI address space, only need to specify
      the address base of the 1st PWM module.

  "#pwm-cells":
     # See pwm.yaml in this directory for a description of the cells format.
     const: 2

  qcom,num-channels:
    description:
      The number of the PWM channels (modules) with the adjacent SPMI address
      space following the address base in "reg" property.

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - "#pwm-cells"
  - qcom,num-channels

additionalProperties: false

    pm8350c_pwm: pwms@e800 {
        compatible = "qcom,pwm";
