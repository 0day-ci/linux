title: Slave-specific properties for a SPI bus.

description: |
  Many SPI controllers need to add properties to slave devices. This could be
  the delay in clock or data lines, etc. These properties are controller
  specific but need to be defined in the slave node because they are per-slave
  and there can be multiple slaves attached to a controller.

  If these properties are not added to the slave binding, then the dtbs check
  emits a warning. But these properties do not make much sense in the slave
  binding because they are controller-specific and they will just pollute every
  slave binding. So this binding is added to collect all such properties from
  all such controllers. Slave bindings should simply refer to this binding and
  they should be rid of the warnings.
