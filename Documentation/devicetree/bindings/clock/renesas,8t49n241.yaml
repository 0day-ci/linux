title: Binding for Renesas 8T49N241 Universal Frequency Translator

description: |
  The 8T49N241 has one fractional-feedback PLL that can be used as a
  jitter attenuator and frequency translator. It is equipped with one
  integer and three fractional output dividers, allowing the generation
  of up to four different output frequencies, ranging from 8kHz to 1GHz.
  These frequencies are completely independent of each other, the input
  reference frequencies and the crystal reference frequency. The device
  places virtually no constraints on input to output frequency conversion,
  supporting all FEC rates, including the new revision of ITU-T
  Recommendation G.709 (2009), most with 0ppm conversion error.
  The outputs may select among LVPECL, LVDS, HCSL or LVCMOS output levels.

  The driver can read a full register map from the DT, and will use that
  register map to initialize the attached part (via I2C) when the system
  boots. Any configuration not supported by the common clock framework
  must be done via the full register map, including optimized settings.

  The 8T49N241 accepts up to two differential or single-ended input clocks
  and a fundamental-mode crystal input. The internal PLL can lock to either
  of the input reference clocks or just to the crystal to behave as a
  frequency synthesizer. The PLL can use the second input for redundant
  backup of the primary input reference, but in this case, both input clock
  references must be related in frequency.

  All outputs are currently assumed to be LVDS, unless overridden in the
  full register map in the DT.
