* Marvell Armada 3720 UART clocks

Required properties:
- compatible: "marvell,armada-3700-uart-clock"
- reg: two 4-bytes registers: UART Clock Control and UART 2 Baud Rate Divisor
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1
- clocks: List of parent clocks suitable for UART from following set:
		"TBG-A-P", "TBG-B-P", "TBG-A-S", "TBG-B-S", "xtal"
	UART clock can use one from this set and when more are provided
	then kernel would choose and configure the most suitable one.
	It is suggest to specify at least one TBG clock to achieve
	baudrates above 230400 and also to specify clock which bootloader
	used for UART (most probably xtal) for smooth boot log on UART.

Example:
	uartclk: uartclk@12000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-uart-clock";
		reg = <0x12010 0x4>, <0x12210 0x4>;
		clocks = <&tbg 0>, <&tbg 1>, <&tbg 2>,
			<&tbg 3>, <&xtalclk>;
		clock-names = "TBG-A-P", "TBG-B-P", "TBG-A-S",
			"TBG-B-S", "xtal";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
