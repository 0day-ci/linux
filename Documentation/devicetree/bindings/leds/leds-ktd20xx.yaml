title: LED driver for KTD20xx RGB LED from Kinetic.

maintainers:
  - Florian Eckert <fe@dev.tdt.de>

description: |
  The KTD20XX is multi-channel, I2C RGB LED Drivers that can group RGB LEDs into
  a LED group or control them individually.

  The difference in these RGB LED drivers is I2C address number the device is
  listen on.
