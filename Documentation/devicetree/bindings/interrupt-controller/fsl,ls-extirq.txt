* Freescale Layerscape external IRQs

Some Layerscape SOCs (LS1021A, LS1043A, LS1046A
LS1088A, LS208xA, LX216xA) support inverting
the polarity of certain external interrupt lines.

The device node must be a child of the node representing the
Supplemental Configuration Unit (SCFG).

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,<soc-name>-extirq", e.g. "fsl,ls1021a-extirq".
  "fsl,ls1043a-extirq": for LS1043A, LS1046A.
  "fsl,ls1088a-extirq": for LS1088A, LS208xA, LX216xA.
- #interrupt-cells: Must be 2. The first element is the index of the
  external interrupt line. The second element is the trigger type.
- #address-cells: Must be 0.
- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- reg: Specifies the Interrupt Polarity Control Register (INTPCR) in
  the SCFG or the External Interrupt Control Register (IRQCR) in
  the ISC.
- fsl,extirq-map: An array of elements through which the mapping between
  external interrupts and GIC interrupts is specified. The first member of each
  array element is the index of the extirq line. The second member must be
  zero. The third member must be a phandle to the interrupt parent (the GIC).
  The remaining number of members in an array element depends on the
  #interrupt-cells property of the interrupt parent, and are used to specify
  the parent interrupt.

Example:
	scfg: scfg@1570000 {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-scfg", "syscon";
		reg = <0x0 0x1570000 0x0 0x10000>;
		big-endian;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges = <0x0 0x0 0x1570000 0x10000>;

		extirq: interrupt-controller@1ac {
			compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-extirq";
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
			#address-cells = <0>;
			interrupt-controller;
			reg = <0x1ac 4>;
			fsl,extirq-map =
				<0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 163 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<1 0 &gic GIC_SPI 164 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<2 0 &gic GIC_SPI 165 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<3 0 &gic GIC_SPI 167 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<4 0 &gic GIC_SPI 168 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<5 0 &gic GIC_SPI 169 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		};
	};


	interrupts-extended = <&gic GIC_SPI 88 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			      <&extirq 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
