title: ARM Vectored Interrupt Controller

maintainers:

description: |+
  One or more Vectored Interrupt Controllers (VIC's) can be connected in an
  ARM system for interrupt routing.  For multiple controllers they can either
  be nested or have the outputs wire-OR'd together.

  "#interrupt-cells":
    const: 1
    description:
      The number of cells to define the interrupts.  It must be 1 as the
      VIC has no configuration options for interrupt sources. The single
      cell defines the interrupt number.

  valid-mask:
    description:
      A one cell big bit mask of valid interrupt sources. Each bit
      represents single interrupt source, starting from source 0 at
      LSb and ending at source 31 at MSb. A bit that is set means
      that the source is wired and clear means otherwise. If unspecified,
      defaults to all valid.

  valid-wakeup-mask:
    description:
      A one cell big bit mask of interrupt sources that can be configured
      as wake up source for the system. Order of bits is the same as for
      valid-mask property. A set bit means that this interrupt source
      can be configured as a wake up source for the system. If unspecied,
      defaults to all interrupt sources configurable as wake up sources.
