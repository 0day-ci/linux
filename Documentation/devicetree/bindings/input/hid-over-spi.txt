* HID over SPI Device-Tree bindings

HID over SPI provides support for Human Interface Devices over the SPI bus. HID
Over SPI Protocol Specification 1.0 was written by Microsoft and is available at
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=103325.

If this binding is used, the kernel module spi-hid will handle the communication
with the device and the generic hid core layer will handle the protocol.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "hid-over-spi"
- interrupts: interrupt line
- vdd-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
- reset_gpio-gpios: gpio wired to the device reset line
- post-power-on-delay-ms: time required by the device after enabling its
regulators or powering it on, before it is ready for communication 
- minimal-reset-delay-ms: minimum amount of time that device needs to be in
reset state for the reset to take effect
- input-report-header-address: this property and the rest are described in HID
Over SPI Protocol Spec 1.0
- input-report-body-address
- output-report-address
- read-opcode
- write-opcode
- flags

Example:
	spi-hid-dev0 {
		compatible = "hid-over-spi";
		reg = <0>;
		interrupts-extended = <&tlmm 42 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8350c_l3>;
		input-report-header-address = <0x1000>;
		input-report-body-address = <0x1004>;
		output-report-address = <0x2000>;
		read-opcode = <0x0b>;
		write-opcode = <0x02>;
		flags = <0x00>;
		reset_gpio-gpios = <&tlmm 25 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		post-power-on-delay-ms = <5>;
		minimal-reset-delay-ms = <5>;
		
	};
