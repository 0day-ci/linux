* NXP PCA9541 I2C bus master selector

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must be "nxp,pca9541"

  - reg: The I2C address of the device.

Optional Properties:

 - release-delay-us: the number of microseconds to delay before
   releasing the bus after a transaction.  If unspecified the default
   is zero (the bus is released immediately).  Non-zero values can
   reduce arbitration overhead for back-to-back transactions, at the
   cost of delaying the other master's access to the bus.

  The following required properties are defined externally:

  - I2C arbitration bus node. See i2c-arb.txt in this directory.


Example:

	i2c-arbitrator@74 {
		compatible = "nxp,pca9541";
		reg = <0x74>;
		release-delay-us = <20000>;

		i2c-arb {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			eeprom@54 {
				compatible = "atmel,24c08";
				reg = <0x54>;
			};
		};
	};
