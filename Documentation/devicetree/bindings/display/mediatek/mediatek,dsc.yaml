  The DSC standard is a specification of the algorithms used for
  compressing and decompressing image display streams, including
  the specification of the syntax and semantics of the compressed
  video bit stream. DSC is designed for real-time systems with
  real-time compression, transmission, decompression and Display.

  mediatek,gce-client-reg:
    description: The register of display function block to be set by gce.
      There are 4 arguments in this property, such as gce node, subsys id, offset
      and register size. The subsys id that is mapping to the register of display
      function blocks is defined in the gce header
      include/include/dt-bindings/gce/<chip>-gce.h of each chips.
      For example, The mediatek,gce-client-reg property of OVL in mt8173 is
      <&gce SUBSYS_1400XXXX 0xc000 0x1000>.
