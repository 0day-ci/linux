* snd-soc-dummy

This node models the snd-soc-dummy.
This is useful to create dummy codec devices where we need to have
some DAI links without a real Codec.

Required properties:
- compatible   : "asoc,snd-soc-dummy"


Example:

dummy_codec {
	compatible = "asoc,snd-soc-dummy";
	#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
};
