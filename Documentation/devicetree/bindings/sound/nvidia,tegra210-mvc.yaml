title: Tegra210 MVC Device Tree Bindings

description: |
  The Master Volume Control (MVC) provides gain or attenuation to a digital
  signal path. It can be used in input or output signal path for per-stream
  volume control or it can be used as master volume control. The MVC block
  has one input and one output. The input digital stream can be mono or
  multi-channel (up to 7.1 channels) stream. An independent mute control is
  also included in the MVC block.
