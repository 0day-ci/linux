      rockchip,enable-ssc:
        type: boolean
        description:
          The option SSC can be enabled for U3, SATA and PCIE.
          Most commercially available platforms use SSC to reduce EMI.

      rockchip,ext-refclk:
        type: boolean
        description:
          Many PCIe connections, especially backplane connections,
          require a synchronous reference clock between the two link partners.
          To achieve this a common clock source, referred to as REFCLK in
          the PCI Express Card Electromechanical Specification,
          should be used by both ends of the PCIe link.
          In PCIe mode one can choose to use an internal
          or an external reference clock.
          By default the internal clock is selected. The PCIe PHY provides a 100MHz
          differential clock output(optional with SSC) for system applications.
          When selecting this option an externally 100MHz differential
          reference clock needs to be provided to the PCIe PHY.
