description: |
  Lattice CPLD onboard the TN48M switches is used for system
  management.

  It provides information about the hardware model, revision,
  PSU status etc.

  It is also being used as a GPIO expander for the SFP slots.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: delta,tn48m-cpld

  reg:
    description:
      I2C device address.
    maxItems: 1

  gpio-controller: true

  "#gpio-cells":
    const: 2
    description:
      The first cell is the pin number and the second cell is used to specify
      the gpio active state.

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - gpio-controller
  - "#gpio-cells"

additionalProperties: false

    i2c {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        cpld@41 {
            compatible = "delta,tn48m-cpld";
