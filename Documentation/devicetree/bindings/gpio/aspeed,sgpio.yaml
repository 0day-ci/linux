title: Aspeed SGPIO controller

maintainers:
  - Andrew Jeffery <andrew@aj.id.au>

description:
  This SGPIO controller is for ASPEED AST2400, AST2500 and AST2600 SoC,
  AST2600 have two sgpio master one with 128 pins another one with 80 pins,
  AST2500/AST2400 have one sgpio master with 80 pins. Each of the Serial
  GPIO pins can be programmed to support the following options
  - Support interrupt option for each input port and various interrupt
    sensitivity option (level-high, level-low, edge-high, edge-low)
  - Support reset tolerance option for each output port
  - Directly connected to APB bus and its shift clock is from APB bus clock
    divided by a programmable value.
  - Co-work with external signal-chained TTL components (74LV165/74LV595)

  max-ngpios:
    description:
      represents the number of actual hardware-supported GPIOs (ie,
      slots within the clocked serial GPIO data). Since each HW GPIO is both an
      input and an output, we provide max_ngpios * 2 lines on our gpiochip
      device. We also use it to define the split between the inputs and
      outputs; the inputs start at line 0, the outputs start at max_ngpios.
