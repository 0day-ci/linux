description: |+

  A System on Chip contains a multitude of active components and each
  of them is a source of heat. Even if a temperature sensor is not
  present, a source of heat can be controlled by acting on the
  consumed power via different techniques.

  A powerzone describes a component or a group of components where we
  can control the maximum power consumption. For instance, a group of
  CPUs via the performance domain, a LCD screen via the brightness,
  etc ...

  Different components when they are used together can significantly
  increase the overall temperature, so the description needs to
  reflect this dependency in order to assign a power budget for a
  group of powerzones.

  This description is done via a hierarchy and the DT reflects it. It
  does not represent the physical location or a topology, eg. on a
  big.Little system, the little CPUs may not be represented as they do
  not contribute significantly to the heat, however the GPU can be
  tied with the big CPUs as they usually have a connection for
  multimedia or game workloads.

      Number of cells in powerzone specifier. Typically 0 for nodes
      representing but it can be any number in the future to describe

  powerzone:
    description:
      A phandle to a parent powerzone. If no powerzone attribute is set, the
      described powerzone is the topmost in the hierarchy.
