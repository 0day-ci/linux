title: Energy Model Bindings

description: |+
  Devices work at specific performance states (frequencies). The power which
  is used at a given performance state is an important information. A framework
  which maintains this information is Energy Model. This document defines
  bindings for these Energy Model performance states applicable across wide
  range of devices. For illustration purpose, this document uses GPU as a device.

  This binding only supports frequency-power pairs.
