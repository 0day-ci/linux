* HPE GXP UMAC MDIO Interface Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Must contain "hpe,gxp-umac-mdio".
- reg:  Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt number.
- Cells which are configuring the external phy interfaces. Numbered through relative addressing each phy is compatible with a standard ethernet-phy-ieee802.3 phy.

Example:

	mdio0: mdio@c0004080 {
		compatible = "hpe,gxp-umac-mdio";
		reg = <0xc0004080 0x10>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		ext_phy0: ethernt-phy@0 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			phy-mode = "sgmii";
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
