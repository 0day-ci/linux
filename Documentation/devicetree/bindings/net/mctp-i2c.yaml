title: MCTP I2C transport binding

description:
  The MCTP I2C binding defines an MCTP endpoint on the I2C bus to
  communicate with I2C peripherals using MCTP (DMTF specification DSP0237).

  An mctp-i2c device must be attached to a hardware bus adapter which supports
  slave functionality. The reg address must include I2C_OWN_SLAVE_ADDRESS.
