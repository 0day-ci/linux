description:
  The generic MCTP I2C binding defines an MCTP endpoint on an existing I2C
  adapter. MCTP I2C is specified by DMTF DSP0237.

  An mctp-i2c-generic device must be attached to a hardware bus adapter
  which supports slave functionality.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: mctp-i2c-generic

  reg:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      7 bit I2C address of the endpoint.
      I2C_OWN_SLAVE_ADDRESS flag must be set (described in i2c.txt)

additionalProperties: false

required:
  - compatible
  - reg

examples:
  - |
    #include <dt-bindings/i2c/i2c.h>
    i2c {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        mctp@50 {
            compatible = "mctp-i2c";
            reg = <(0x50 | I2C_OWN_SLAVE_ADDRESS)>;
