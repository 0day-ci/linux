description:
  The Aspeed UART routing control allow to dynamically route the inputs for
  the built-in UARTS and physical serial I/O ports.

  This allows, for example, to connect the output of UART to another UART.
  This can be used to enable Host <-> BMC communication via UARTs, e.g. to
  allow access to the Host's serial console.

  This driver is for the BMC side. The sysfs files allow the BMC userspace
  which owns the system configuration policy, to configure how UARTs and
  physical serial I/O ports are routed.

  Two types of files, uart* and io*, are presented in sysfs. The uart*
  configures the input signal of a UART controller whereas io* configures
  that of a physical serial port.

  When read, each file shows the list of available options with currently
  selected option marked by brackets "[]". The list of available options
  depends on the selected file.

  e.g.
  cat /sys/bus/platform/drivers/aspeed-uart-routing/*.uart_routing/uart1
  [io1] io2 io3 io4 uart2 uart3 uart4 io6

  In this case, UART1 gets its input from IO1 (physical serial port 1).
