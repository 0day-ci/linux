* HPE GXP XREG INTERFACE

Required parent device properties:
- compatible : Should be "hpe,gxp-fn2", "simple-mfd", "syscon".
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the control registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt number.
- interrupt-parent: main interrupt controller to which xreg is connected to
- #gpio-cells : The number of cells to describe a GPIO, this should be 2.

Example:

	xreg: xreg@d1000300 {
		compatible = "hpe,gxp-xreg", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
		reg = <0xd1000300 0xFF>;
		interrupts = <26>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic0>;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
	};
