* HPE GXP CHIF INTERFACE

Define the basic CHannel InterFace (CHIF) communication path between BMC and Host through PCI.
Interrupts are handled through PCI function 2

Required parent device properties:
- compatible : Should be "hpe,gxp-chif".
- interrupts : The interrupt number.

Example:

	chif {
			compatible = "hpe,gxp-chif";
			interrupts = <12>;
		};
	};
