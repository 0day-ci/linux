* HPE GXP PCI FN2 INTERFACE CONTROLLER

Required parent device properties:
- compatible : Should be "hpe,gxp-fn2", "simple-mfd", "syscon".
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the control/data/memory mapped registers.
- xreg_handle : Phandle to the xregister controller interface.
- #gpio-cells : The number of cells to describe a GPIO, this should be 2.
- interrupts : interrupt number to which PCI FN2 is connected to
- interrupt-parets : interrupt controller to which PCI FN2 is connected to

Example:

	fn2: fn2@80200000 {
		compatible = "hpe,gxp-fn2", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
		reg = <0x80200000 0x100000>;
		xreg_handle = <&xreg>;
		interrupts = <0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
	};
