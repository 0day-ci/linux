* HPE GXP DBG INTERFACE

Specify host debug interface. Used presently to report ROM POST code during host initialization phases

Required parent device properties:
- compatible : Should be "hpe,gxp-dbg".
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the control/data registers.
- interrupts: The interrupt number.
- interrupt-parent: The interrupt controller to which the interface is wired to

Example:

	post@800000a0 {
		compatible = "hpe,gxp-dbg";
		reg = <0x800000a0 0x20>;
		interrupts = <10>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
	};
