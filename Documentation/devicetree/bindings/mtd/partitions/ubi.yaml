title: UBI (Unsorted Block Images) device

description: |
  UBI is a layer providing logical volumes (consisting of logical blocks) on top
  of raw flash devices. It deals with low-level flash issues (bit-flips, bad
  physical eraseblocks, wearing) providing a reliable data storage.

  UBI device is built and stored in a single flash partition.

  Some (usually embedded) devices use UBI volumes of specific names or indexes
  to store setup / configuration data. This binding allows describing such
  volumes so they can be identified and referenced by consumers.
