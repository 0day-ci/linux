What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/buffer/length
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Number of scans contained by the buffer.

		Since Kernel 5.11, multiple buffers are supported.
		so, it is better to use, instead:
			/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/bufferY/length

KernelVersion:	2.6.35

Description:
		Actually start the buffer capture up.  Will start trigger
		if first device and appropriate.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/scan_elements
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Directory containing interfaces for elements that will be
		captured for a single triggered sample set in the buffer.

		Since kernel 5.11 the scan_elements attributes are merged into
		the bufferY directory, to be configurable per buffer.

Description:
		Scan element control for triggered data capture.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/buffer/watermark
KernelVersion:	4.2
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A single positive integer specifying the maximum number of scan
		elements to wait for.

		Poll will block until the watermark is reached.

		Blocking read will wait until the minimum between the requested
		read amount or the low water mark is available.

		Non-blocking read will retrieve the available samples from the
		buffer even if there are less samples then watermark level. This
		allows the application to block on poll with a timeout and read
		the available samples after the timeout expires and thus have a
		maximum delay guarantee.

		Since Kernel 5.11, multiple buffers are supported.
		so, it is better to use, instead:
			/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/bufferY/watermark

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/buffer/data_available
KernelVersion: 4.16
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A read-only value indicating the bytes of data available in the
		buffer. In the case of an output buffer, this indicates the
		amount of empty space available to write data to. In the case of
		an input buffer, this indicates the amount of data available for
		reading.

		Since Kernel 5.11, multiple buffers are supported.
		so, it is better to use, instead:
			/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/bufferY/data_available
