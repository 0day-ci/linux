Description:
		The ioctl interface to drivers for platform firmware runtime
		update(PFRU). Following actions are supported:

		* PFRU_IOC_QUERY_CAP: Read the PFRU Runtime Update capability.
		  The value is a structure of pfru_update_cap_info.
		  See include/uapi/linux/pfru.h for definition.

		* PFRU_SET_REV: Set the Revision ID for PFRU Runtime Update.
		  It could be either 1 or 2.

		* PFRU_IOC_STAGE: Stage a capsule image from communication
		  buffer and perform authentication.

		* PFRU_IOC_ACTIVATE: Activate a previous staged capsule image.

		* PFRU_IOC_STAGE_ACTIVATE: Perform both stage and activation
		  actions.

		* PFRU_LOG_IOC_SET_INFO: set log information in Telemetry
		  Service. The input is a structure of pfru_log_info.
		  This structure includes log revision id(1 or 2),
		  log level(0 : Error Message, 1 : Warning Message,
		  2 : Informational Message, 4 : Verbose), log data type
		  (0 : Execution Log, 1 : History Information).
		  See include/uapi/linux/pfru.h for definition.

		* PFRU_LOG_IOC_GET_INFO: get log information in Telemetry.
		  The output is a structure of pfru_log_info.

		* PFRU_LOG_IOC_GET_DATA_INFO: get log data information in
		  Telemetry. The output is a structure of pfru_log_data_info.
		  See include/uapi/linux/pfru.h for definition.

		Besides ioctl interface, write() and read() are supported on
		/dev/acpi_pfru. The write() will be the code injection/update,
		and the read() will be telemetry retrieval.
