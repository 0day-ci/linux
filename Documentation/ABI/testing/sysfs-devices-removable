Description:
		Information about whether a given device is physically fixed to
		the platform. This is determined by the device's subsystem in a
		bus / platform specific way. This attribute is only present for
		buses that can support determining such information:

		"removable": The device is external / removable from the system.
		"fixed":     The device is internal / fixed to the system.
		"unknown":   The information is unavailable.

		Currently this is only supported by USB (which infers the
		information from a combination of hub descriptor bits and
		platform-specific data such as ACPI) and PCI (which gets this
		from ACPI / device tree).
