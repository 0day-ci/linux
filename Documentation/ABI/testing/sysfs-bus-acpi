What:		/sys/bus/acpi/devices/.../status
Date:		Jan, 2014
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		(RO) Returns the ACPI device status: enabled, disabled or
		functioning or present, if the method _STA is present.

		The return value is a decimal integer representing the device's
		status bitmap:

		===========  ==================================================
		Bit [0]      Set if the device is present.
		Bit [1]      Set if the device is enabled and decoding its
		             resources.
		Bit [2]      Set if the device should be shown in the UI.
		Bit [3]      Set if the device is functioning properly (cleared
			     if device failed its diagnostics).
		Bit [4]      Set if the battery is present.
		Bits [31:5]  Reserved (must be cleared)
		===========  ==================================================

		If bit [0] is clear, then bit 1 must also be clear (a device
		that is not present cannot be enabled).

		Bit 0 can be clear (not present) with bit [3] set (device is
		functional).  This case is used to indicate a valid device for
		which no device driver should be loaded.

		More special cases are covered in the ACPI specification.

Date:		Apr, 2016
Contact:	Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@rjwysocki.net>
Description:
		(RO) Allows users to read the hardware version of non-PCI
		hardware, if the _HRV control method is present.  It is mostly
		useful for non-PCI devices because lspci can list the hardware
		version for PCI devices.
