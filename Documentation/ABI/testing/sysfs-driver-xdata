What:		/sys/class/misc/drivers/dw-xdata-pcie.<device>/write
Date:		April 2021
KernelVersion:	5.13
Contact:	Gustavo Pimentel <gustavo.pimentel@synopsys.com>
Description:	Allows the user to enable the PCIe traffic generator which
		will create write TLPs frames - from the Root Complex to the
		Endpoint direction.
		Usage e.g.
		 echo 1 > /sys/class/misc/dw-xdata-pcie.<device>/write

		The user can read the current PCIe link throughput generated
		through this generator in MB/s.
		Usage e.g.
		 cat /sys/class/misc/dw-xdata-pcie.<device>/write
		 204

		The file is read and write.
