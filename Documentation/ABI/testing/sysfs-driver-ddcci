		a fixed serial number if it's positive, a temporary serial number 
		if negative and zero if the Identification command is not supported,
		and modalias, a combined identifier for driver selection, 
		it has the form ddcci:<idProt>-<idType>-<idModel>-<idVendor>-<idModule>,
		All non-alphanumeric characters (including whitespace) in the model, 
		vendor or module parts are replaced by underscores to prevent issues
