Description:	This file is the main device on the I2C bus, it exports
		the following peices of information about the device, capabilities
		which is a full ACCESS.bus capabilities string(see the ACCESS.bus
		specification for more info), idProt, which is a full ACCESS.bus
		protocol supported by the device(Usually "monitor"), idType,
		a ACCESS.buss device subtype(Usually "LCD" or "CRT"), idModel, a
		ACCESS.bus device model identifier(Usually a shortened form of the
		device model name), idVendor, a ACCESS.bus device vendor identifier
		(Empty if the Identification command is not supported), idModule,
		a ACCESS.bus device module identifier(Empty if the Identification
		command is not supported), idSerial, a 32 bit device number
		a fixed serial number if it's positive, a temporary serial number
		if negative and zero if the Identification command is not supported,
		and modalias, a combined identifier for driver selection,
		it has the form ddcci:<idProt>-<idType>-<idModel>-<idVendor>-<idModule>,
		All non-alphanumeric characters (including whitespace) in the model,
		vendor or module parts are replaced by underscores to prevent issues
		with software like systemd-udevd. See Documentation/misc-devices/ddcci.rst
		for more information on DDC/CI.
