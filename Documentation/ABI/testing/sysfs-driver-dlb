Description:
		The total_resources subdirectory contains read-only files that
		indicate the total number of resources in the device.

		num_atomic_inflights:  Total number of atomic inflights in the
				       device. Atomic inflights refers to the
				       on-device storage used by the atomic
				       scheduler.

		num_dir_credits:       Total number of directed credits in the
				       device.

		num_dir_ports:	       Total number of directed ports (and
				       queues) in the device.

		num_hist_list_entries: Total number of history list entries in
				       the device.

		num_ldb_credits:       Total number of load-balanced credits in
				       the device.

		num_ldb_ports:	       Total number of load-balanced ports in
				       the device.

		num_cos<M>_ldb_ports:  Total number of load-balanced ports
				       belonging to class-of-service M in the
				       device.

		num_ldb_queues:	       Total number of load-balanced queues in
				       the device.

		num_sched_domains:     Total number of scheduling domains in the
				       device.

Description:
		The avail_resources subdirectory contains read-only files that
		indicate the available number of resources in the device.
		"Available" here means resources that are not currently in use
		by an application or, in the case of a physical function
		device, assigned to a virtual function.

		num_atomic_inflights:  Available number of atomic inflights in
				       the device.

		num_dir_ports:	       Available number of directed ports (and
				       queues) in the device.

		num_hist_list_entries: Available number of history list entries
				       in the device.

		num_ldb_credits:       Available number of load-balanced credits
				       in the device.

		num_ldb_ports:	       Available number of load-balanced ports
				       in the device.

		num_cos<M>_ldb_ports:  Available number of load-balanced ports
				       belonging to class-of-service M in the
				       device.

		num_ldb_queues:	       Available number of load-balanced queues
				       in the device.

		num_sched_domains:     Available number of scheduling domains in
				       the device.

		max_ctg_hl_entries:    Maximum contiguous history list entries
				       available in the device.

				       Each scheduling domain is created with
				       an allocation of history list entries,
				       and each domain's allocation of entries
				       must be contiguous.

Description:	Device ID used in /dev, i.e. /dev/dlb<device ID>

		Each DLB 2.0 PF and VF device is granted a unique ID by the
		kernel driver, and this ID is used to construct the device's
		/dev directory: /dev/dlb<device ID>. This sysfs file can be read
		to determine a device's ID, which allows the user to map a
		device file to a PCI BDF.
