Description:
	Read and write the ams AS5600 internal registers and their
	fields. zpos/mpos can be used to create a subset of the 0-360
	degree range. status_md will tell whether the magnet is
	detected. Check the datasheet
	(https://ams.com/documents/20143/36005/AS5600_DS000365_5-00.pdf)
	for more information.
