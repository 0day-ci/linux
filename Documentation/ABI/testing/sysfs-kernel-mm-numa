Description:	Enable/disable demoting pages during reclaim

		Page migration during reclaim is intended for systems
		with tiered memory configurations.  These systems have
		multiple types of memory with varied performance
		characteristics instead of plain NUMA systems where
		the same kind of memory is found at varied distances.
		Allowing page migration during reclaim enables these
		systems to migrate pages from fast tiers to slow tiers
		when the fast tier is under pressure.  This migration
		is performed before swap.  It may move data to a NUMA
		node that does not fall into the cpuset of the
		allocating process which might be construed to violate
		the guarantees of cpusets.  This should not be enabled
		on systems which need strict cpuset location
		guarantees.

Description:	Set the demotion mode when enabling demoting pages during reclaim

		Specify the demotion mode. "direct" is for the DIRECT_DEMOTION
		mode if the system's multiple memory types are one to one
		correspondence, the node distance among the multiple memory types
		is tiered.

		"multiple" is for the MULTIPLE_DEMOTION mode if the system's
		multiple memory types are not one to one correspondence, the node
		distance between fast memory node and slow memory nodes is equal,
		which means one fast memory node can be demoted to multiple slow
		memory nodes.
