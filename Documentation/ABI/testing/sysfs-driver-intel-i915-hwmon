Description:
                RO. Energy input of device in microjoules.

		The returned textual representation is an unsigned integer
		number that can be stored in 64-bits.  Warning: The hardware
		register is 32-bits wide and can overflow by wrapping around.
		A single wrap-around between calls to read this value can
		be detected and will be accounted for in the returned value.
		At a power consumption of 1 watt, the 32-bit hardware register
		would wrap-around approximately every 3 days.

		Only supported for particular Intel i915 graphics platforms.
