 * domain).  Allowed accesses are set once (e.g. at file opening) and never
 * change after that.  As a side effect, this means that such cache created
 * before a domain transition will not get an up to date allowed accesses.
 * This implies to always check a cached domain against the current domain
 * thanks to landlock_cache_is_valid().
 *
 * This struct is part of a typed cache (e.g. &struct landlock_fs_cache.core)
 * that identifies the tied object.
