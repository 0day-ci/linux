* commit 7c734359d350 ("qlge: Size RX buffers based on MTU.", v2.6.33-rc1)
  introduced dead code in the receive routines, which should be rewritten
  anyways by the admission of the author himself, see the comment above
  ql_build_rx_skb(). That function is now used exclusively to handle packets
  that underwent header splitting but it still contains code to handle non
  split cases.
* the driver has a habit of using runtime checks where compile time checks are
  possible (ex. ql_free_rx_buffers(), ql_alloc_rx_buffers())
* remove duplicate and useless comments
* fix weird line wrapping (all over, ex. the ql_set_routing_reg() calls in
  qlge_set_multicast_list()).
* fix weird indentation (all over, ex. the for loops in qlge_get_stats())
* fix checkpatch issues
