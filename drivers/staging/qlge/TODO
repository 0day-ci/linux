* the driver has a habit of using runtime checks where compile time checks are
  possible (ex. ql_free_rx_buffers(), ql_alloc_rx_buffers())
* remove duplicate and useless comments
* fix weird line wrapping (all over, ex. the ql_set_routing_reg() calls in
  qlge_set_multicast_list()).
* fix weird indentation (all over, ex. the for loops in qlge_get_stats())
* fix checkpatch issues
