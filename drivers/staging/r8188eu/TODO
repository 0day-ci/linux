To-do list:

* Correct the coding style according to Linux guidelines; please read the document
at https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html.
* Remove unnecessary debugging/printing macros; for those that are still needed
use the proper kernel API (pr_debug(), dev_dbg(), netdev_dbg()).
* Remove dead code such as unusued functions, variables, fields, etc..
* Use in-kernel API and remove unnecessary wrappers where possible.
* Remove the HAL layer and migrate its functionality into the relevant parts of
the driver.
* Switch to use LIB80211 (This work is currently in development by Larry Finger).
* Switch to use MAC80211 (This work is currently in development by Larry Finger).

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>,
Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>, Phillip Potter <phil@philpotter.co.uk>
and CC linux-staging@lists.linux.dev, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org.
