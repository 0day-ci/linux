	bool "Intel x86 Platform Specific Device Drivers"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to get to see options for device drivers for
	  various Intel x86 platforms, including vendor-specific
	  drivers. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped
	  and disabled.

config INTEL_HID_EVENT
	tristate "INTEL HID Event"
	depends on ACPI
	depends on INPUT
	depends on I2C
	select INPUT_SPARSEKMAP
	help
	  This driver provides support for the Intel HID Event hotkey interface.
	  Some laptops require this driver for hotkey support.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called intel_hid.

config INTEL_BXTWC_PMIC_TMU
	tristate "Intel BXT Whiskey Cove TMU Driver"
	depends on REGMAP
	depends on MFD_INTEL_PMC_BXT
	depends on INTEL_SOC_PMIC_BXTWC
	help
	  Select this driver to use Intel BXT Whiskey Cove PMIC TMU feature.
	  This driver enables the alarm wakeup functionality in the TMU unit
	  of Whiskey Cove PMIC.

config INTEL_CHTDC_TI_PWRBTN
	tristate "Intel Cherry Trail Dollar Cove TI power button driver"
	depends on INTEL_SOC_PMIC_CHTDC_TI
	depends on INPUT
	help
	  This option adds a power button driver driver for Dollar Cove TI
	  PMIC on Intel Cherry Trail devices.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called intel_chtdc_ti_pwrbtn.

config INTEL_MRFLD_PWRBTN
	tristate "Intel Merrifield Basin Cove power button driver"
	depends on INTEL_SOC_PMIC_MRFLD
	depends on INPUT
	help
	  This option adds a power button driver for Basin Cove PMIC
	  on Intel Merrifield devices.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called intel_mrfld_pwrbtn.

config INTEL_PUNIT_IPC
	tristate "Intel P-Unit IPC Driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for Intel P-Unit Mailbox IPC mechanism,
	  which is used to bridge the communications between kernel and P-Unit.

config INTEL_IPS
	tristate "Intel Intelligent Power Sharing"
	depends on ACPI && PCI
	help
	  Intel Calpella platforms support dynamic power sharing between the
	  CPU and GPU, maximizing performance in a given TDP.  This driver,
	  along with the CPU frequency and i915 drivers, provides that
	  functionality.  If in doubt, say Y here; it will only load on
	  supported platforms.

config INTEL_RST
        tristate "Intel Rapid Start Technology Driver"
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  This driver provides support for modifying parameters on systems
	  equipped with Intel's Rapid Start Technology. When put in an ACPI
	  sleep state, these devices will wake after either a configured
	  timeout or when the system battery reaches a critical state,
	  automatically copying memory contents to disk. On resume, the
	  firmware will copy the memory contents back to RAM and resume the OS
	  as usual.

config INTEL_SMARTCONNECT
        tristate "Intel Smart Connect disabling driver"
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  Intel Smart Connect is a technology intended to permit devices to
	  update state by resuming for a short period of time at regular
	  intervals. If a user enables this functionality under Windows and
	  then reboots into Linux, the system may remain configured to resume
	  on suspend. In the absence of any userspace to support it, the system
	  will then remain awake until something triggers another suspend.

	  This driver checks to determine whether the device has Intel Smart
	  Connect enabled, and if so disables it.

config INTEL_TURBO_MAX_3
	bool "Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 enumeration driver"
	depends on X86_64 && SCHED_MC_PRIO
	help
	  This driver reads maximum performance ratio of each CPU and set up
	  the scheduler priority metrics. In this way scheduler can prefer
	  CPU with higher performance to schedule tasks.
	  This driver is only required when the system is not using Hardware
	  P-States (HWP). In HWP mode, priority can be read from ACPI tables.

config INTEL_UNCORE_FREQ_CONTROL
	tristate "Intel Uncore frequency control driver"
	depends on X86_64
	help
	  This driver allows control of uncore frequency limits on
	  supported server platforms.
	  Uncore frequency controls RING/LLC (last-level cache) clocks.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called intel-uncore-frequency.
