	  Say Y to enable drivers for Xilinx LogiCORE PR Decoupler
	  or Xilinx Dynamic Function eXchnage AIX Shutdown Manager.
	  The PR Decoupler exists in the FPGA fabric to isolate one
	  region of the FPGA from the busses while that region is
	  being reprogrammed during partial reconfig.
	  The Dynamic Function eXchange AXI shutdown manager prevents
	  AXI traffic from passing through the bridge. The controller
	  safely handles AXI4MM and AXI4-Lite interfaces on a
	  Reconfigurable Partition when it is undergoing dynamic
	  reconfiguration, preventing the system deadlock that can
	  occur if AXI transactions are interrupted by DFX.
