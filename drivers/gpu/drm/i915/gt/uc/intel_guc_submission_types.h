 *
 * Currently we have two instances of these per GuC. One for single-lrc and one
 * for multi-lrc submission. We split these into two submission engines as they
 * can operate in parallel allowing a blocking condition on one not to affect
 * the other. i.e. guc_ids are statically allocated between these two submission
 * modes. One mode may have guc_ids exhausted which requires blocking while the
 * other has plenty of guc_ids and can make forward progres.
 *
 * In the future if different submission use cases arise we can simply
 * instantiate another of these objects and assign it to the context.
