config PATA_PARPORT_ATEN
	tristate "ATEN EH-100 protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the ATEN EH-100 parallel port IDE
	  protocol. This protocol is used in some inexpensive low performance
	  parallel port kits made in Hong Kong. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT
	  support into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the
	  protocol driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a
	  loadable module. The module will be called aten.

config PATA_PARPORT_BPCK
	tristate "MicroSolutions backpack (Series 5) protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the Micro Solutions BACKPACK
	  parallel port Series 5 IDE protocol.  (Most BACKPACK drives made
	  before 1999 were Series 5) Series 5 drives will NOT always have the
	  Series noted on the bottom of the drive. Series 6 drivers will.

	  In other words, if your BACKPACK drive doesn't say "Series 6" on the
	  bottom, enable this option.

	  If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you may
	  answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you should
	  answer M to build it as a loadable module.  The module will be
	  called bpck.

config PATA_PARPORT_BPCK6
	tristate "MicroSolutions backpack (Series 6) protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT && !64BIT
	help
	  This option enables support for the Micro Solutions BACKPACK
	  parallel port Series 6 IDE protocol.  (Most BACKPACK drives made
	  after 1999 were Series 6) Series 6 drives will have the Series noted
	  on the bottom of the drive.  Series 5 drivers don't always have it
	  noted.

	  In other words, if your BACKPACK drive says "Series 6" on the
	  bottom, enable this option.

	  If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you may
	  answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you should
	  answer M to build it as a loadable module.  The module will be
	  called bpck6.

config PATA_PARPORT_COMM
	tristate "DataStor Commuter protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the Commuter parallel port IDE
	  protocol from DataStor. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support
	  into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the protocol
	  driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable
	  module. The module will be called comm.

config PATA_PARPORT_DSTR
	tristate "DataStor EP-2000 protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the EP-2000 parallel port IDE
	  protocol from DataStor. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support
	  into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the protocol
	  driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable
	  module. The module will be called dstr.

config PATA_PARPORT_FIT2
	tristate "FIT TD-2000 protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the TD-2000 parallel port IDE
	  protocol from Fidelity International Technology. This is a simple
	  (low speed) adapter that is used in some portable hard drives. If
	  you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you may answer Y
	  here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you should answer M
	  to build it as a loadable module. The module will be called ktti.

config PATA_PARPORT_FIT3
	tristate "FIT TD-3000 protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the TD-3000 parallel port IDE
	  protocol from Fidelity International Technology. This protocol is
	  used in newer models of their portable disk, CD-ROM and PD/CD
	  devices. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you
	  may answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you
	  should answer M to build it as a loadable module. The module will be
	  called fit3.

config PATA_PARPORT_EPAT
	tristate "Shuttle EPAT/EPEZ protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the EPAT parallel port IDE protocol.
	  EPAT is a parallel port IDE adapter manufactured by Shuttle
	  Technology and widely used in devices from major vendors such as
	  Hewlett-Packard, SyQuest, Imation and Avatar. If you chose to build
	  PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in
	  the protocol driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a
	  loadable module. The module will be called epat.

config PATA_PARPORT_EPIA
	tristate "Shuttle EPIA protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the (obsolete) EPIA parallel port
	  IDE protocol from Shuttle Technology. This adapter can still be
	  found in some no-name kits. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support
	  into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the protocol
	  driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable
	  module. The module will be called epia.

config PATA_PARPORT_FRIQ
	tristate "Freecom IQ ASIC-2 protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for version 2 of the Freecom IQ parallel
	  port IDE adapter.  This adapter is used by the Maxell Superdisk
	  drive.  If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you
	  may answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you
	  should answer M to build it as a loadable module. The module will be
	  called friq. You must also have a high-level driver for the type
	  of device that you want to support.

config PATA_PARPORT_FRPW
	tristate "FreeCom power protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the Freecom power parallel port IDE
	  protocol. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you
	  may answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you
	  should answer M to build it as a loadable module. The module will be
	  called frpw.

	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the KBIC-951A and KBIC-971A parallel
	  port IDE protocols from KingByte Information Corp. KingByte's
	  adapters appear in many no-name portable disk and CD-ROM products,
	  especially in Europe. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your
	  kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the protocol driver,
	  otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable module. The
	  module will be called kbic.
