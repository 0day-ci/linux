config PATA_PARPORT_ATEN
	tristate "ATEN EH-100 protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the ATEN EH-100 parallel port IDE
	  protocol. This protocol is used in some inexpensive low performance
	  parallel port kits made in Hong Kong. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT
	  support into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the
	  protocol driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a
	  loadable module. The module will be called aten.

config PATA_PARPORT_BPCK
	tristate "MicroSolutions backpack (Series 5) protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the Micro Solutions BACKPACK
	  parallel port Series 5 IDE protocol.  (Most BACKPACK drives made
	  before 1999 were Series 5) Series 5 drives will NOT always have the
	  Series noted on the bottom of the drive. Series 6 drivers will.

	  In other words, if your BACKPACK drive doesn't say "Series 6" on the
	  bottom, enable this option.

	  If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you may
	  answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you should
	  answer M to build it as a loadable module.  The module will be
	  called bpck.

config PATA_PARPORT_BPCK6
	tristate "MicroSolutions backpack (Series 6) protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT && !64BIT
	help
	  This option enables support for the Micro Solutions BACKPACK
	  parallel port Series 6 IDE protocol.  (Most BACKPACK drives made
	  after 1999 were Series 6) Series 6 drives will have the Series noted
	  on the bottom of the drive.  Series 5 drivers don't always have it
	  noted.

	  In other words, if your BACKPACK drive says "Series 6" on the

	  If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you may

	  called bpck6.

config PATA_PARPORT_COMM
	tristate "DataStor Commuter protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the Commuter parallel port IDE
	  protocol from DataStor. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support
	  into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the protocol
	  driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable
	  module. The module will be called comm.

config PATA_PARPORT_DSTR
	tristate "DataStor EP-2000 protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the EP-2000 parallel port IDE
	  protocol from DataStor. If you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support
	  into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the protocol
	  driver, otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable
	  module. The module will be called dstr.

config PATA_PARPORT_FIT2
	tristate "FIT TD-2000 protocol"
	depends on PATA_PARPORT
	help
	  This option enables support for the TD-2000 parallel port IDE
	  protocol from Fidelity International Technology. This is a simple
	  (low speed) adapter that is used in some portable hard drives. If
	  you chose to build PATA_PARPORT support into your kernel, you may answer Y
	  here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you should answer M
	  to build it as a loadable module. The module will be called ktti.
