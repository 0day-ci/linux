	  In order to reduce the system reboot times and update the platform firmware
	  in time, Platform Firmware Runtime Update is leveraged to patch the system
	  without reboot. This driver supports Platform Firmware Runtime Update,
	  which is composed of two parts: code injection and driver update. It also
	  allows telemetry data to be retrieved from the platform firmware.

	  For more information, see:
	  <file:Documentation/ABI/testing/pfru>

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called pfru_update.
