	help
	  PCS driver for the Xilinx 1G/2.5G Ethernet PCS/PMA or SGMII device.
	  This device can either act as a PCS+PMA for 1000BASE-X or 2500BASE-X,
	  or as a GMII-to-SGMII bridge. It can also switch between 1000BASE-X
	  and SGMII dynamically if configured correctly when synthesized.
	  Typical applications use this device on an FPGA connected to a GEM or
	  TEMAC on the GMII side. The other side is typically connected to
	  on-device gigabit transceivers, off-device SERDES devices using TBI,
	  or LVDS IO resources directly.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called pcs-xilinx.
