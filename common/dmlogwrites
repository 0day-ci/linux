# Starting from v4.15-rc1, DAX support was added to dm-log-writes, but note
# that it doesn't track the data that we write via the mmap(), so we can't do
# any data integrity checking. We can only verify that the metadata writes for
# the page faults happened, e.g. when mmap(2) with MAP_SYNC flag.
#
# Introduce a new helper to check if dm-log-writes target supports DAX
# explicitly. But this is considered as a temporary workaround, we want to move
# all the DAX check back to _require_log_writes when dm-log-writes gains full
# DAX support and remove this helper.
