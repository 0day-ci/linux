# chattr with [iap..] attributes open file for read-only and
# invoke ioctl(). If we chattr a lower file in overlay, it
# will get the lower file but not trigger copy-up, so ioctl()
# lead to modification of that lower file.
#
# Upstream Commit 7c6893e3c9ab ("ovl: don't allow writing
# ioctl on lower layer") return EPERM for this case to avoid
# this issue.
