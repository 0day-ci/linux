This is 'iw', a tool to use nl80211.


To build iw, just enter 'make'. If that fails, copy the file
defconfig to .config and adjust the settings in it.


'iw' is currently maintained at http://git.sipsolutions.net/iw.git/,
some more documentation is available at
http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw.

Please send all patches to Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>
and CC linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org for community review.
